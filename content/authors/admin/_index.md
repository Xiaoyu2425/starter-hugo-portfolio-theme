I am a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on the Environmental Microbiology track in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Prior to MIT, I did undergraduate and postgraduate studies at Zhejiang Univeristy and Tsinghua University in China. I will join California Institute of Technology as a postdoc soon. 

My research mainly focuses on ecology and evolution in microbial communities by combining theoretical, computational and experimental efforts. I am also very interested in advancing sustainability in agricultural, industrial and social systems by leveraging what we have learned in ecology and evolution. I was a youth delegate of the 19th tripartite environmental ministers meeting among China, Japan and Korea. 

I have been a Morningside Scholar since 2015, as which I completed extra coursework in art and humanity, as well as engaged in oversea studies in Hong Kong, Europe and US.
